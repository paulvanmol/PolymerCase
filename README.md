# Case Study PolymerCase: Root Cause Analysis
Clear Plastic is made by heating and stirring a monomer in a batch reactor until it polymerises.  When the reaction is complete the molten polymer is granulated and packed.  The plant makes 3 batches per day 24/7.

The following data on the last 110 batches were collected: 
Y's (outputs)
Yield (to be maximized)
MFI Melt flow index of the polymer <198
CI Colour index of the polymer >80
